## Section 1: Core AI Security

### Top 10 Security Highlights
1. **Ollama Exposure Crisis**: Researchers discovered over 175,000 publicly exposed Ollama AI servers across 130 countries, creating a massive unmanaged layer of AI compute vulnerable to exploitation. [Source](https://thehackernews.com/2026/01/researchers-find-175000-publicly.html)
2. **The "Invisible" Workforce**: Enterprises have deployed over 3M AI agents, but nearly 1.5M are currently unmonitored and "out of control," posing significant corporate risk. [Source](https://securityboulevard.com/2026/02/the-invisible-risk-1-5-million-unmonitored-ai-agents-threaten-corporate-security/)
3. **8-Minute AWS Breach**: An AI-assisted attack leveraged exposed credentials in S3 buckets to achieve administrative privileges in an AWS environment in under 10 minutes. [Source](https://www.darkreading.com/cloud-security/8-minute-access-ai-aws-environment-breach)
4. **Open-Source Risks**: Researchers warn that open-source LLMs running outside major platforms often have guardrails removed, making them prime targets for criminal misuse. [Source](https://www.reuters.com/technology/open-source-ai-models-vulnerable-criminal-misuse-researchers-warn-2026-01-29/)
5. **Signal's Warning**: Signal President Meredith Whittaker warns that AI agents embedded in OS layers are making end-to-end encryption (E2EE) practically irrelevant by accessing data at the endpoint. [Source](https://cyberinsider.com/signal-president-warns-ai-agents-are-making-encryption-irrelevant/)
6. **Moltbot (OpenClaw) Crisis**: Palo Alto Networks highlights "Moltbot" (OpenClaw) as a potential security crisis due to its high autonomy and rapid adoption (85k+ stars in a week). [Source](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/network-security/why-moltbot-may-signal-ai-crisis/)
7. **Infrastructure Hijacking**: Cybercriminals are increasingly hijacking and reselling AI infrastructure to power malicious activities. [Source](https://www.csoonline.com/article/4123806/crooks-are-hijacking-and-reselling-ai-infrastructure-report.html)
8. **Agentic AI & Data Protection**: The UK ICO released early views on the data protection implications of autonomous agentic AI. [Source](https://www.insideglobaltech.com/2026/02/05/ico-shares-early-views-on-agentic-ai-data-protection/)
9. **AI Triage Agents**: GitHub Security Lab introduced the "Taskflow Agent" to help researchers triage vulnerabilities using LLMs. [Source](https://github.blog/security/ai-supported-vulnerability-triage-with-the-github-security-lab-taskflow-agent/)
10. **Scaling Risks**: New reports suggest that as AI scales, small bugs in complex dependency layers are evolving into "explosive" systemic risks. [Source](https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/scaling-ai-through-exploding-risks-and-evolving-attacks/)

### Deep Dive 1: The OS-Level Threat to Encryption
Signal’s Meredith Whittaker has flagged a critical shift: the "Encryption Bypass" isn't about breaking math, but about agentic access. As AI agents like Apple Intelligence or Microsoft Recall integrate directly into the OS, they capture data *before* it's encrypted or *after* it's decrypted. This "endpoint takeover" by benevolent agents creates a massive surface for malicious ones to piggyback on.

### Deep Dive 2: 1.5 Million Ghost Agents
The Gravitee study on "unmonitored agents" highlights a shadow IT crisis 2.0. Companies are racing to deploy agents for efficiency, but legacy security stacks (IAM, EDR) aren't designed to track non-human, multi-step autonomous workflows. We are seeing the birth of an "invisible workforce" with unrestricted API access.

### Watch List
*   **Ollama Instances**: If you're running local LLMs, ensure they aren't bound to `0.0.0.0` without a proxy/auth.
*   **Repo Poisoning**: Look out for "Notepad++" style supply chain attacks targeting developer LLM extensions.

### Security Recommendations
1.  **Audit Agentic Permissions**: Review any agentic system (like OpenClaw or AutoGPT) for broad file-system or network access.
2.  **Zero-Trust for APIs**: Treat every AI agent trigger as an untrusted external request, regardless of whether it "started" internally.
