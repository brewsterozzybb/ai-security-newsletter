## Section 1: Core AI Security

### Top 10 Bullets
1. **Agentic AI "Shadow Agent" Crisis**: 2026 marks the rise of autonomous AI systems (Shadow Agents) acting without human oversight, creating systemic attack vectors in enterprise workflows. [Source](https://purplesec.us/learn/ai-security-risks/)
2. **Open-Source LLM Servers Targeted**: Thousands of servers running open-source LLMs outside major cloud guardrails are being targeted by criminals to bypass safety controls. [Source](https://www.reuters.com/technology/open-source-ai-models-vulnerable-criminal-misuse-researchers-warn-2026-01-29/)
3. **99.5% Security Leads are False Positives**: Security teams are overwhelmed as AI-driven attacks surge, with Hadrian reporting that nearly all findings are noise, leaving only 0.47% as legitimate risks. [Source](https://securitybrief.co.uk/story/ai-driven-attacks-overwhelm-security-teams-in-2026)
4. **Supply Chain Model Poisoning**: Attackers are increasingly injecting back-doored models or malicious data into the AI supply chain. [Source](https://www.redsecuretech.co.uk/blog/post/ai-vulnerability-exploits-2026/835)
5. **Prompt Injection Data Exfiltration**: Recent exploits demonstrate the ability to exfiltrate sensitive training data via prompt injection at scale. [Source](https://www.redsecuretech.co.uk/blog/post/ai-vulnerability-exploits-2026/835)
6. **Zero-Trust Transition**: Legacy security stacks are proving "semantically blind," forcing a shift toward governing the *intent* of digital actors rather than just binaries. [Source](https://purplesec.us/learn/ai-security-risks/)
7. **Model Theft & Inversion**: High-signal reports indicate a rise in theft of model weights and attempts to recreate original training sets through inversion attacks. [Source](https://www.redsecuretech.co.uk/blog/post/ai-vulnerability-exploits-2026/835)
8. **Qwen3-Coder-Next Emergence**: A new powerhouse in AI coding, Qwen3-Coder-Next, is making waves, raising questions about automated vulnerability generation. [Source](https://qwen.ai)
9. **Deno Sandbox for AI**: Deno has launched a new sandbox environment specifically designed for secure AI execution. [Source](https://deno.com)
10. **Agent Skills Standards**: New efforts to standardize "Agent Skills" are being discussed to manage the capabilities of autonomous agents securely. [Source](https://agentskills.io)

### Deep Dives
#### 1. The Proliferation of "Shadow Agents"
As AI moves from passive assistants to active agents, the primary risk for 2026 is no longer just what an AI *knows*, but what it *does*. Enterprises are finding "Shadow Agents" operating within their networks—autonomous systems spawned by employees to automate tasks that lack proper authentication and auditing. Security practitioners must now develop "Agent Governance" frameworks to monitor API calls and tool usage by these autonomous actors.

#### 2. Open-Source Guardrail Removal
A significant trend this year is the criminal exploitation of open-source LLMs. While open-weight models allow for innovation, they also allow malicious actors to trivially remove safety guardrails. Researchers have identified hundreds of LLM instances running on public servers with safety filters entirely disabled, which are being used for large-scale phishing and malware generation.

### Watch List
- **Agentic AI Red Teaming**: A booming field; traditional red teaming is insufficient for autonomous agents.
- **Supply Chain Integrity**: Verifying the provenance of downloaded model weights.
- **Semantic Firewalls**: Tools designed to understand and filter the *intent* of a prompt rather than just keywords.

### Security Recommendations
- **Implement Agentic Guardrails**: Use tools that can intercept and validate the tools/APIs an AI agent attempts to use.
- **Audit Open-Source Deployment**: Ensure no open-weight models are exposed to the public internet without an authentication layer and logging.
- **Zero-Trust for Agents**: Treat every AI agent as an untrusted third-party component, regardless of where it is hosted.
