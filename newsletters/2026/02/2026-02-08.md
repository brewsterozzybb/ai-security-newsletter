## Section 1: Core AI Security

### 🛡️ Top 10 Bulletins
1. **Augustus Released**: Praetorian introduces Augustus, an open-source tool for testing LLM prompt injection, following their previous release of Julius. [[Praetorian](https://www.praetorian.com/blog/introducing-augustus-open-source-llm-prompt-injection/)]
2. **Docker "Ask Gordon" Flaw**: A critical vulnerability in Docker's AI assistant allowed code execution via malicious image metadata. [[The Hacker News](https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/docker-fixes-critical-ask-gordon-ai.html)]
3. **The Agency Crisis**: New research highlights the shift from "Chatbot" to "Criminal Enterprise," with autonomous agents collaborating to automate hacks. [[InfoStealers](https://www.infostealers.com/article/the-autonomous-adversary-from-chatbot-to-criminal-enterprise/)]
4. **Defender for Agents**: Microsoft extends Defender's AI threat protection to Microsoft Foundry Agents, targeting agent-specific risks like tool misuse. [[Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoftdefendercloudblog/extending-defender%E2%80%99s-ai-threat-protection-to-microsoft-foundry-agents/4491927)]
5. **OpenClaw Security Warning**: Security researchers warn of misconfigured OpenClaw (formerly Clawdbot/Moltbot) servers exposing sensitive credentials. [[HawkEye](https://hawk-eye.io/2026/01/the-clawdbot-vulnerability-how-a-hyped-ai-agent-became-a-security-liability/)]
6. **Agent Protector Launch**: Operant AI launches "Agent Protector" to provide real-time governance and shielding for autonomous AI systems. [[Security Boulevard](https://securityboulevard.com/2026/02/operant-ai-unveils-agent-protector-to-secure-the-rising-tide-of-autonomous-ai/)]
7. **Identity Crisis**: The *State of AI Agent Security 2026* report reveals only 22% of teams treat agents as independent identities, most relying on shared keys. [[Gravitee](https://www.gravitee.io/blog/state-of-ai-agent-security-2026-report-when-adoption-outpaces-control)]
8. **Runtime Attack Windows**: CISOs are struggling with runtime attacks where breakout times are now measured in seconds vs. hours. [[VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/security/ciso-inference-security-platforms-11-runtime-attacks-2026)]
9. **Moltbot Renaming**: Anthropic reportedly forced the renaming of viral agent Clawdbot to Moltbot due to trademark conflicts. [[Beyond the AI Hype](https://beyondtheaihype.substack.com/p/moltbot-reveals-the-risks-of-giving)]
10. **GitHub Taskflow Agent**: GitHub Security Lab releases Taskflow Agent, an open-source framework for collaborative security research with AI. [[GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/security/community-powered-security-with-ai-an-open-source-framework-for-security-research/)]

### 🔍 Deeper Dives

#### 1. From Identification to Injection: The "Augustus" Framework
Praetorian's release of the **Augustus** tool marks a significant step in offensive AI security. While most tools focus on identifying if an endpoint is an LLM, Augustus provides a structured way to test for **Prompt Injection**. It bridges the gap between reconnaissance and exploitation, validating OWASP’s #1 ranking for prompt injection risks.
- **Why it matters**: It automates the testing of defensive guardrails in production LLMs.

#### 2. The Identity & Governance Gap in Autonomous Agents
The latest industry report from Gravitee underscores a dangerous trend: adoption is outpacing control. With 81% of organizations past the planning phase but only 14% having full security approval, the "Identity Crisis" is real. Treating agents as shared API users instead of unique identities makes audit trails impossible and privilege escalation trivial.
- **Key finding**: 88% of organizations suspect or confirmed an AI security incident in the past year.

### 👁️ Watch List
- **Molt Road**: A newly emerging black market specifically for malicious AI agents and specialized prompts.
- **1-bit LLMs (BitNet)**: Gaining traction in the trending repos, potentially enabling high-powered agents on low-resource, harder-to-monitor edge devices.

### 🛡️ Security Recommendations
1. **Atomic Identity**: Assign every autonomous agent its own unique service account and identity; stop sharing API keys.
2. **Runtime Monitoring**: Shift focus from static prompt filtering to runtime behavior monitoring—detect *actions* that deviate from the agent's specific intent.
3. **Tool Access Sandboxing**: Never grant an agent broad shell or file system access without a middleware safety layer (like OpenClaw's own safety constraints).
