## Section 1: Core AI Security

### Top 10 Bulletins
*   **Large Reasoning Models as Autonomous Jailbreakers**: Research published in *Nature* identifies that large reasoning models (like o1/DeepSeek-R1 style architectures) can autonomously act as jailbreaking agents, discovering vulnerabilities in other models without human intervention. [[Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-69010-1)]
*   **AISURU/Kimwolf Botnet Sets Record**: The AI-driven botnet launched a record-shattering 31.4 Tbps DDoS attack, demonstrating the scale of botnets managed by autonomous systems. [[The Hacker News](https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/aisurukimwolf-botnet-launches-record.html)]
*   **Global Jailbreak Threat via Poetic Attacks**: AI CERTs reveals that hand-crafted and automated poetry bypasses safety filters in 62% of trials across leading LLMs. [[AI CERTs](https://www.aicerts.ai/news/global-ai-jailbreak-threat-revealed/)]
*   **Open-Source Model Misuse**: Researchers warn that thousands of servers running open-source LLMs without standard safety controls are being actively exploited for criminal activity. [[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/open-source-ai-models-vulnerable-criminal-misuse-researchers-warn-2026-01-29/)]
*   **The "Crisis of Agency"**: A deep dive into prompt injection within autonomous AI agents highlights that the more agency we give AI, the larger the blast radius for simple prompt overrides. [[Medium](https://gregrobison.medium.com/the-crisis-of-agency-a-comprehensive-analysis-of-prompt-injection-and-the-security-architecture-of-d274524b3c11)]
*   **Jailbreaking to Jailbreak**: A new Scale Red Team paper "Jailbreaking to Jailbreak" explores recursive red-teaming where one model is used to iteratively compromise another. [[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09638)]
*   **LLM Forensics Guides**: New guides on LLM attack transcripts and forensic breakdowns are helping security teams identify successful prompt injections in production logs. [[Medium](https://medium.com/@karthikmulugu14/llm-jailbreaks-in-the-wild-attack-transcripts-forensics-guardrail-architecture-and-python-e434bb87990e)]
*   **From Vibe Coding to Jailbreaking**: Comparative studies show that the "vibe coding" era (prioritizing rapid generation) has left significant security gaps in standard LLM deployments. [[MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2673-4591/123/1/8)]
*   **Ghidra MCP Server for RE**: A new MCP server for Ghidra offers 110 tools for AI-assisted reverse engineering, simplifying documentation across binary updates. [[GitHub](https://github.com/bethington/ghidra-mcp-server) via [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46882389)]
*   **LLM Attack Techniques 2026**: A comprehensive library of 70+ documented LLM attack techniques has been released, providing a baseline for security audit teams. [[LockLLM](https://www.lockllm.com/blog/llm-attack-techniques-2026)]

### Deep Dives
1.  **Autonomous Jailbreaking Agents**: The *Nature* study is a wake-up call. It proves that reasoning models don't just "fail" safely; they can be turned into active hunters. The "thought process" capability of these models allows them to try thousands of variations of an attack until one sticks, bypassing traditional static filters.
2.  **The Rise of AI Botnets**: The 31.4 Tbps attack by AISURU/Kimwolf highlights a new era of infrastructure-level threats. When botnets are controlled by AI that can adapt to mitigation strategies in real-time, 35-second bursts are enough to cripple even the most robust CDNs before human operators can respond.

### Watch List
*   **Multi-turn Manipulation**: Attacks that span dozens of messages to slowly "poison" the context window.
*   **Shadow Open-Source Models**: Locally hosted models with hard-coded "jailbreaks" being used for spear-phishing at scale.

### Security Recommendations
*   **Implement "Thought-Trace" Monitoring**: If you use reasoning models, monitor their internal reasoning (where accessible) for adversarial patterns.
*   **Zero-Trust for AI Output**: Treat every AI-generated command or configuration as untrusted user input, especially in autonomous pipelines.
