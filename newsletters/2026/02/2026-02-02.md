## 🛡️ Top 10 High-Level Insights
1. **Agentic Loop Exploitation**: Emerging vulnerabilities in autonomous agents that permit recursive prompt injection, leading to unintended tool execution.
2. **Knowledge Distillation Poisoning**: Clean-dataset poisoning techniques targeting the distillation process in smaller "edge" LLMs.
3. **Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI)**: Increase in attacks utilizing hidden instructions in SVG and PDF metadata to bypass RAG system filters.
4. **Token-Level Obfuscation**: Research into Unicode-based "invisible" character injections that circumvent traditional string-based sanitizers.
5. **Model Weight Stealing**: Advanced side-channel attacks targeting hardware inference accelerators (TPUs/GPUs) to reconstruct private model weights.
6. **Hallucination Triggering**: Targeted data-poisoning of public documentation to force specific, dangerous hallucinations in RAG pipelines.
7. **Adversarial LoRA Injections**: The risk of "Trojan" LoRA adapters distributed on public hubs that appear helpful but contain latent backdoors.
8. **PII Leakage in Multi-Modal**: Vulnerabilities in image-to-text encoders allowing for the extraction of training data through specific adversarial visual patterns.
9. **Circuit Breaker Bypasses**: Novel jailbreak techniques using "pre-fill" manipulation to disable safety-alignment circuit breakers in real-time.
10. **Shadow AI Governance**: The continued rise of unmanaged AI usage ("BYO-LLM") in corporate environments bypassing established SOC monitoring.

## 🔍 Deep Dives

### 1. Autonomous Agent Tool-Call Hijacking
Recent theoretical research highlights a critical flaw in how LLMs handle tool definitions. By injecting "system-like" commands into the output of one tool, an attacker can trick the LLM into thinking the next logical step is to execute a high-privilege tool (like `exec` or `delete`) with attacker-controlled parameters. This "Recursive Tool Injection" is particularly dangerous in systems where agents have persistent memory.

### 2. The Rise of "Trojan" Fine-Tuning
As more organizations use PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) such as LoRA, the supply chain for these adapters has become a target. A "Trojan" adapter can behave perfectly for 99.9% of queries but trigger a malicious override when a specific "trigger" token (e.g., a specific UUID or rare word) is present. Detection remains difficult as the base model remains "safe."

## 👁️ Watch List
- **OWASP Top 10 for LLMs v2.0**: Keep an eye on the upcoming revisions focusing on agentic risks.
- **Hardware-Enclave Inference**: Following the development of TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments) for private AI.
- **Differential Privacy in RAG**: Emerging standards for masking sensitive data within vector databases.

## 🛠️ Key Security Recommendations
- **Isolated Execution**: Always run AI-connected tools in ephemeral, sandboxed environments with zero network access.
- **Human-in-the-loop (HITL)**: Mandatory for any action involving file deletion, financial transactions, or external communications.
- **Output Sanitization**: Treat LLM outputs as untrusted user input; validate schemas and types before passing to downstream functions.

**TODO: Sources**
- Integrate Brave Search API for live citations in future editions.
- Monitor ArXiv for the "Recursive Tool Injection" paper citations.
