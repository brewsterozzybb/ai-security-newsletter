## 🔥 This Week's Top Story

### AI Goes C2: Copilot and Grok Turned Into Covert Malware Relays

Check Point Research dropped a consequential finding this week: **AI assistants with web-browsing and URL-fetching capabilities can be abused as covert command-and-control (C2) relays** — and they've demonstrated it against Microsoft Copilot and xAI Grok.

The technique, dubbed **"AI as a C2 Proxy"**, works by having malware communicate with attacker-controlled URLs through the AI assistant's browsing/summarization feature. Because AI service domains are routinely allow-listed in enterprise environments, the traffic blends seamlessly into normal corporate egress. No suspicious C2 IP. No unusual protocol. Just a chatbot fetching URLs.

Worse: it's not just a relay. The same mechanism enables **AI-assisted malware operations** — reconnaissance workflows, scripted attacker actions, and real-time adaptive decisions ("what to do next") based on environmental feedback from the compromised host. This is the shift from AI helping write malware to AI *being part of the malware's runtime*.

> **Why it matters:** Enterprise security teams have broadly allow-listed AI platforms as trusted business tools. That trust is now a threat vector. Behavioral detection, not domain-based allow-listing, is the only durable defense.

## 🧨 Vulnerability Roundup

### 128M VS Code Installs Exposed — Four Extensions, Multiple Critical CVEs

OX Security researchers disclosed critical vulnerabilities in **four widely-used VS Code extensions** with a combined install count exceeding 128 million:

| Extension | CVE | CVSS | Impact | Status |
|-----------|-----|------|--------|--------|
| Live Server | CVE-2025-65717 | 9.1 | Local file exfiltration via malicious webpage | **Unpatched** |
| Markdown Preview Enhanced | CVE-2025-65716 | 8.8 | Arbitrary JS execution via crafted .md file | **Unpatched** |
| Code Runner | CVE-2025-65715 | 7.8 | RCE | Patched |
| Microsoft Live Preview | CVE-2025-65714 | — | File theft | Patched |

The attack vector for Live Server (CVSS 9.1) is especially nasty: trick a developer into visiting a malicious webpage while the extension is running, and JavaScript in that page crawls the local dev server at `localhost:5500`, exfiltrating files to an attacker-controlled domain. No install required — just one click on a link.

> **Key quote (OX Security):** "A hacker needs only one malicious extension, or a single vulnerability within one extension, to perform lateral movement and compromise entire organizations."

**Action:** Disable Live Server and Markdown Preview Enhanced until patches land. Review extension audit policies.

### Cloudflare Agents: XSS in AI Playground OAuth Callback (CVE-2026-1721)

The OAuth callback handler in Cloudflare's AI Playground (`agents` npm package) directly interpolated the `error_description` query parameter into an inline `<script>` tag — textbook reflected XSS. Exploiting it lets attackers **steal all user chat message history and LLM interaction logs** from the victim's session.

**Impact:** Anyone using Cloudflare's agent framework who visited a crafted OAuth error URL was exposed. Patch your `agents` dependency.

## 🎯 Attacks & Research

### CRESCENTHARVEST: Iranian Protest Supporters Targeted With RAT

Acronis Threat Research Unit (TRU) disclosed **CRESCENTHARVEST**, an active espionage campaign targeting supporters of Iran's ongoing protests. Active since at least January 9, 2026, the campaign delivers a full-featured remote access trojan (RAT) designed for long-term information theft and surveillance.

Confirmed targets include diaspora communities and activist networks. The campaign is geopolitically timed — attacks spiked alongside protest activity — and the RAT has persistent access capabilities consistent with state-sponsored intent.

### 30+ Fake AI Chrome Extensions: 300K Users, Credentials Stolen

A cluster of 30+ malicious Chrome extensions masquerading as AI assistants has been installed by over **300,000 users**. The extensions silently steal:

- API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Email content
- Browsing history and session cookies

The social engineering hook is straightforward: users searching for AI productivity tools land on look-alike extensions with convincing names and ratings. Once installed, they operate normally while exfiltrating in the background.

> **The lesson:** "Download an AI assistant" is the new "download a free PDF converter." Browser extension supply chain hygiene is now an AI security problem.

### Promptware Kill Chain: A Framework for AI-Powered Malware

Researchers proposed the **"Promptware Kill Chain"** — a 7-stage framework specifically for AI-powered malware attacks, analogous to Lockheed Martin's cyber kill chain but adapted for LLM-enabled intrusions:

1. **Reconnaissance** — AI-assisted target profiling
2. **Weaponization** — Prompt engineering for payload generation
3. **Delivery** — AI-crafted phishing/social engineering
4. **Exploitation** — Prompt injection / AI C2 relay
5. **Installation** — AI-adapted persistence mechanisms
6. **C2** — Prompt-driven adaptive command execution
7. **Actions on Objectives** — AI-prioritized data exfiltration

The framework gives defenders a structured way to think about AI-native threat actors — and highlights where traditional kill chain defenses fall short.

## 🌍 Policy & Industry

### Google at Munich Security Conference: "AI Is Sharpening Attacker Tactics"

At the **62nd Munich Security Conference (MSC 2026)**, Google's Kent Walker and the Google Threat Intelligence Group presented findings from their AI Threat Tracker. Key points:

- Nation-state threat actors are using AI models (including Gemini, abused via jailbreak or direct API access) to automate reconnaissance, generate hyper-realistic phishing kits, and stage malware
- The EU Cybersecurity Agency (ENISA) director Juhan Lepassaar called for a full defensive rethink: "We need a rethink" — not an upgrade
- MSC 2026's security consensus: **fragmented AI governance + isolated defenses = systemic failure**

Google simultaneously published its **2026 Responsible AI Progress Report**, detailing internal safety measures and red-teaming investments — a useful contrast to the threat intelligence painting of what attackers are already doing.

### Cybersecurity Tech Predictions for 2026: Zero Trust, PQC, AI Defense

The Hacker News published an industry-consensus piece on what 2026 looks like from a technology perspective:

- **AI defense** overtaking reactive SIEM/SOAR as the new baseline
- **Zero Trust identity** for non-human actors (agents, APIs, bots) as the #1 enterprise priority
- **Post-quantum cryptography (PQC)** migration deadlines forcing real budget conversations
- **Lifecycle security** — baking security into AI model development, not bolting it on after deployment

The common thread: AI is forcing security to think in systems, not products.

### React2Shell: LLM-Generated Malware in the Wild

Darktrace researchers documented a case where hackers **used LLMs to create React2Shell malware** for cryptocurrency mining — exploiting a React2Shell vulnerability with AI-generated exploit code. The malware was functional and deployed in the wild, representing one of the clearest documented cases of AI-generated threat code moving from capability to production attack.

## 🏴 Red Team Corner

### AI C2 Proxy: What Detection Looks Like

The Check Point "AI as a C2 Proxy" technique bypasses most traditional network controls. What defenders *can* do:

| Detection Layer | What to Look For |
|----------------|------------------|
| Network (CASB) | Abnormal query volume to Copilot/Grok from non-user processes |
| Endpoint (EDR) | Process trees where AI API calls originate from non-browser binaries |
| Behavioral | Correlation between AI assistant queries and outbound data transfer patterns |
| Identity | AI assistant sessions authenticated by service accounts, not users |

> **Bottom line:** Allow-listing AI domains while ignoring behavioral signals is the equivalent of allowing HTTPS because "it's encrypted." The domain isn't the threat. The behavior is.
