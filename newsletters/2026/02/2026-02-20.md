SOC Prime DetectFlow OSS pitches an AI-assisted "detection orchestration" layer that applies Sigma rules to streaming log events before they hit your SIEM, tagging matched events with metadata like MITRE ATT&CK technique IDs. The core performance claim is extremely low detection latency and higher rule throughput on existing infrastructure, enabled by in-flight enrichment, rule hot-reload, and scaling without vendor caps. *"Sub-second MTTD: 0.005-0.01 seconds vs 15+ min for SIEM"* *"Result: 10x rule capacity on existing infrastructure."*

The current release centers on a Flink-based ETL/matching pipeline with a real-time dashboard, pipeline management, log source parsing/mapping, Sigma rule management (from cloud sources like SOC Prime Platform or open-source GitHub repos, plus local repos), pre-filters to reduce false positives, Kafka topic sync, and hot-reload for rules/filters/parsers. It outlines a Kubernetes deployment that assumes Kafka, Flink (via Flink Kubernetes Operator + Helm), PostgreSQL, and a multi-node cluster, with separate backend and UI components; operators configure Kafka endpoints, database URLs, images, and then create pipelines tying together source topics, destination topics, rule repositories, log sources, and optional filters. The software is dual-licensed under the European Union Public License v1.2 or the SOC Prime Commercial License, depending on intended use.
Karpathy's "LLM Council" repo proposes a simple local web app that lets you ask multiple LLMs at once (via OpenRouter), compare their answers side by side, then have the models critique and rank each other before a designated "Chairman" model synthesizes a single final response. The workflow is explicitly three stages: (1) collect independent first-pass answers and display them in tabs, (2) have each model review the others' responses with anonymized identities to reduce brand bias while ranking for "accuracy and insight," and (3) have the Chairman compile the council output into one answer.

The README frames this as a lightweight experiment rather than a maintained product: *"This project was 99% vibe coded as a fun Saturday hack"* and *"I'm not going to support it in any way, it's provided here as is..."* Setup is minimal: install dependencies (using `uv` for Python plus `npm` for the frontend), add `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` to a root `.env`, optionally edit `backend/config.py` to choose council members and the Chairman model, then run a start script and open `http://localhost:5173`. The stated stack is FastAPI + async `httpx` on the backend, React/Vite + `react-markdown` on the frontend, with conversations stored as JSON under `data/conversations/`.
